# Arkanoid-SFML

First game created using SFML library with C++. It's a classic arkanoid, which includes 3 levels of difficulty to win a game. 
In the future I plan to implement a scoreboard and some features ,which will allow to add some special bonuses to the game. 

To run it on your computer you need to extract sfml library in other foler on computer. In my case this is E:\Program Files (x86)\SFML-2.5.0.
Don't forget to change the location of SFML in CMakeLists. 

Hope you enjoy
